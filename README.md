[00:11.80] Was it real? Was it mine? Was it worth it?
[00:18.49] Sometimes I feel like a player that struts and frets by the scripts
[00:25.22] All I know is my desire and my love won't fade
[00:30.88] I'll set a fire, burn fears to ashes
[00:48.88] 
[00:37.95] Put some petals on my chest, right on the tear
[00:44.72] I will just fall into that sunset on the rusty sea
[00:51.31] I'm a vessel, done its best to contain their schemes
[00:56.62] Now all sounds are drowning with me
[01:14.12] 
[01:02.39] Through those rainbows, shadows, struggles, muddles
[01:07.37] Clearly, I saw my way to the destiny
[01:12.35] There is something no one can take from me
[01:16.84] On my Laurel, my sword, my battles, and corals sea foam
[01:22.11] I have left my fingerprints
[01:25.75] Pain slipped away in a heartbeat
[01:29.80] I think I've finally found my peace
[01:47.30] 
[01:57.08] All the medals on my chest are glimmering (are glimmering)
[02:03.46] A flash of light burns my eyes
[02:06.68] Making me ponder again
[02:10.25] I burn the clouds with all the fuel in my veins
[02:15.48] But somehow, I linger in doubts
[02:30.98] 
[02:21.32] Through those rainbows, shadows, struggles, muddles
[02:26.05] Clearly, I saw my way to the destiny
[02:31.16] There is something no one can take from me
[02:35.61] All the bruises are the clues that lead me to solution
[02:41.15] To my doubts and deepest fears
[02:44.75] Glory's not all about winning
[02:48.73] But blazing 'til the last minute
[03:04.73] 
[03:10.68] Through those rainbows, shadows, struggles, muddles
[03:15.54] Clearly, I saw my way to the destiny
[03:20.59] There is something no one can take from me
[03:25.02] All the bruises are the clues that lead me to solution
[03:30.14] To my doubts and deepest fears
[03:34.08] Glory's not all about winning
[03:38.25] But blazing 'til the last minute
[03:54.25] 
[03:42.73] Oh-oh
[03:45.93] Oh-oh
