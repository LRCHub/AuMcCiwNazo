[00:11.82] Was it real? Was it mine? Was it worth it?
[00:18.41] Sometimes I feel like a player that struts and frets by the scripts
[00:25.26] All I know is my desire and my love won't fade
[00:30.86] I'll set a fire, burn fears to ashes
[00:48.86] 
[00:37.95] Put some petals on my chest, right on the tear
[00:44.71] I will just fall into that sunset on the rusty sea
[00:51.37] I'm a vessel, done its best to contain their schemes
[00:56.62] Now all sounds are drowning with me
[01:14.12] 
[01:02.39] Through those rainbows, shadows, struggles, muddles
[01:07.33] Clearly, I saw my way to the destiny
[01:12.32] There is something no one can take from me
[01:16.87] On my Laurel, my sword, my battles, and corals sea foam
[01:22.19] I have left my fingerprints
[01:25.70] Pain slipped away in a heartbeat
[01:29.81] I think I've finally found my peace
[01:47.31] 
[01:57.02] All the medals on my chest are glimmering (are glimmering)
[02:03.42] A flash of light burns my eyes
[02:06.60] Making me ponder again
[02:10.30] I burn the clouds with all the fuel in my veins
[02:15.46] But somehow, I linger in doubts
[02:30.96] 
[02:21.36] Through those rainbows, shadows, struggles, muddles
[02:26.04] Clearly, I saw my way to the destiny
[02:31.11] There is something no one can take from me
[02:35.67] All the bruises are the clues that lead me to solution
[02:41.11] To my doubts and deepest fears
[02:44.72] Glory's not all about winning
[02:48.74] But blazing 'til the last minute
[03:04.74] 
[03:10.64] Through those rainbows, shadows, struggles, muddles
[03:15.51] Clearly, I saw my way to the destiny
[03:20.55] There is something no one can take from me
[03:25.08] All the bruises are the clues that lead me to solution
[03:30.13] To my doubts and deepest fears
[03:34.06] Glory's not all about winning
[03:38.25] But blazing 'til the last minute
[03:54.25] 
[03:42.79] Oh-oh
[03:45.92] Oh-oh
